# Story 1.2: Configure Pyright for Strict Type Checking

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** Pyright configured for strict type checking,  
**so that** I can catch type-related errors early and improve code reliability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Pyright is added as a development dependency in `pyproject.toml`.
2. A `[tool.pyright]` configuration is added to `pyproject.toml` enabling `strict` mode.
3. All type errors in the existing codebase are resolved to satisfy the strict checking rules.
4. The project's contribution guidelines are updated with instructions on how to run Pyright.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add Pyright to development dependencies (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add pyright to pyproject.toml dev dependencies
  - [x] Install the updated dependencies
- [x] Configure Pyright for strict mode (AC: 2)
  - [x] Add [tool.pyright] section to pyproject.toml
  - [x] Set typeCheckingMode = "strict"
  - [x] Configure Python version target (3.12)
  - [x] Set up appropriate include/exclude patterns
- [x] Add type annotations to existing code (AC: 3)
  - [x] Annotate all function signatures in cli.py
  - [x] Annotate all methods in manager.py
  - [x] Annotate formatters.py functions
  - [x] Annotate utility functions in utils/
  - [x] Add type stubs for any problematic third-party imports
- [x] Fix all type errors (AC: 3)
  - [x] Run pyright and catalog all errors
  - [x] Fix type errors module by module
  - [x] Ensure all imports have proper types
  - [x] Verify pyright passes with zero errors
- [x] Update documentation (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add pyright command to CLAUDE.md
  - [x] Document type checking workflow
  - [x] Add guidance on maintaining type safety

## Dev Notes

### Current Type Annotation Status

- Limited type hints in existing code
- No type checking currently enforced
- Will need comprehensive annotation pass

### Key Modules Requiring Annotation

1. **cli.py**: Typer commands, console output functions
2. **manager.py**: ContextManager class, state management methods
3. **formatters.py**: File formatting functions
4. **utils/ignore_utils.py**: Gitignore pattern matching
5. **utils/path_utils.py**: Path manipulation functions

### Common Type Patterns

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Set, Optional, Union
from pathlib import Path
import typer
from rich.console import Console
```

### Pyright Strict Mode Considerations

- All functions must have return type annotations
- All parameters must have type annotations
- No implicit Any types allowed
- Proper handling of None/Optional types
- May need # type: ignore for some third-party imports

### Testing Standards

- Type checking should be part of CI/CD pipeline
- Run pyright before committing code
- Maintain 100% type coverage

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-23
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
Excellent implementation of strict type checking. The developer has thoroughly annotated all modules with comprehensive type hints and resolved all 49 initial type errors. The strict mode configuration ensures maximum type safety across the codebase.

### Refactoring Performed
No refactoring required - the implementation is solid and follows best practices. The developer made good decisions including:
- Using proper type imports from typing module
- Handling Pattern type correctly for ignore patterns
- Resolving variable naming conflicts appropriately
- Maintaining clean, readable type annotations

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ All functions have explicit return types as required
- Project Structure: ✓ Configuration properly integrated
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Type checking integrated into workflow
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria satisfied

### Improvements Checklist
All implementation is complete and no improvements needed.

### Security Review
No security concerns - type checking enhances code reliability and helps prevent runtime errors.

### Performance Considerations
Type checking has no runtime impact. Pyright provides fast static analysis during development.

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done
