# Story 2.1: Save and List Context Profiles

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer using contextr,
**I want** to save my current context configuration as a named profile and see all my saved profiles,
**so that** I can preserve and reuse specific file pattern configurations for different tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `ctxr profile save <name>` command implemented
2. `ctxr profile list` shows all saved profiles
3. Overwrite protection with confirmation prompt
4. Profile data persisted to `.contextr/profiles/`
5. Unit tests for save/list functionality

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Profile Storage Design** [Source: architecture.md#storage-architecture]

- Profiles stored as individual JSON files in `.contextr/profiles/` directory
- Each profile file named as `{profile_name}.json`
- Storage backend abstraction from Story 1.4 will be extended for profiles
- Use existing JsonStorage implementation with hierarchical key support

**Profile Schema** [Source: architecture.md#profile-schema]

```json
{
  "name": "frontend",
  "watched_patterns": ["src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.css"],
  "ignore_patterns": ["**/*.test.tsx", "build/**"],
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "2025-07-25T12:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-07-25T12:00:00Z",
    "description": "Frontend development context"
  }
}
```

**ProfileManager Class Design** [Source: architecture.md#profile-architecture-epic-2]

- ProfileManager will handle all profile CRUD operations
- Accepts StorageBackend in constructor for dependency injection
- Methods: save_profile(), list_profiles(), load_profile(), delete_profile()
- Profile operations use prefix "profiles" for storage keys

**CLI Command Structure** [Source: architecture.md#profile-commands-architecture]

- New command group under main app: `ctxr profile`
- Sub-commands: save, load, list, delete
- Use Typer's command groups feature for organization
- Rich console for formatted output

**File Locations Based on Project Structure**:

- ProfileManager class: `src/contextr/profile.py` (new file)
- Profile-related types: Add to existing type definitions or create new types file
- Profile CLI commands: Add to `src/contextr/cli.py`
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_profile.py` (new file)

**Previous Story Insights from Story 1.4**:

- Storage abstraction successfully implemented with StorageBackend ABC
- JsonStorage supports atomic writes using temporary files
- Dependency injection pattern works well for testing with mocked storage
- State persistence uses "state" as storage key

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards** [Source: prd.md#testing-strategy]

- Unit tests required for all new functions
- Mock external dependencies (file system operations)
- Use pytest framework with fixtures
- Target 80% code coverage minimum
- Test files location: `tests/unit/` directory
- Use parametrized tests for multiple scenarios

**Test Patterns from Story 1.4**:

- Mock storage backend for unit tests using `Mock(spec=StorageBackend)`
- Use tmp_path fixture for integration tests
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Verify atomic operations prevent data corruption

### Technical Constraints

- Python 3.12+ type annotations required [Source: prd.md#technology-stack]
- Must pass Ruff linting with zero errors [Source: prd.md#implementation-guidelines]
- Must pass Pyright strict mode type checking [Source: prd.md#implementation-guidelines]
- Line length limit: 88 characters [Source: prd.md#code-style]
- Use Google-style docstrings [Source: prd.md#code-style]

### Performance Requirements

- Profile operations must complete in <100ms [Source: prd.md#performance]
- Use efficient file operations for listing profiles
- Consider caching for frequently accessed profile lists

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-25
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation is well-structured and follows the architectural guidance from Dev Notes. The developer has successfully implemented all acceptance criteria with proper separation of concerns between the Profile data model, ProfileManager business logic, and CLI command layer. The code demonstrates good understanding of dependency injection patterns and maintains consistency with the existing codebase architecture established in Story 1.4.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: src/contextr/profile.py
  - **Change**: Moved regex import to module level and compiled the profile name validation pattern
  - **Why**: Performance optimization - compiling regex patterns at module load time is more efficient than re-importing and compiling on each validation call
  - **How**: Created PROFILE_NAME_PATTERN constant at module level, reducing overhead for repeated validations

- **File**: src/contextr/profile.py
  - **Change**: Added profile name length validation (max 100 characters)
  - **Why**: Security best practice - prevent excessively long profile names that could cause issues with file systems or storage
  - **How**: Added length check in _validate_profile_name method before regex validation

- **File**: tests/unit/test_profile.py
  - **Change**: Added test cases for profile name length validation and type ignore comments for private method access
  - **Why**: Ensure new validation logic is properly tested and resolve Pyright strict mode warnings
  - **How**: Added parametrized test cases for 100 and 101 character names, added type ignore comments for acceptable test access to private methods

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ All code follows Google-style docstrings, proper type annotations, and 88-character line limit
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly placed according to architecture guidance (profile.py in src/contextr/)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with 99% coverage for ProfileManager and Profile classes
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist
[x] Optimized regex pattern compilation for better performance (src/contextr/profile.py)
[x] Added profile name length validation for security (src/contextr/profile.py)
[x] Fixed all Pyright strict mode type checking issues (tests/unit/test_profile.py)
[x] Ensured all code passes Ruff linting with zero errors

### Security Review
No critical security concerns found. The implementation properly validates profile names to prevent directory traversal attacks and uses atomic write operations through the storage backend to prevent data corruption. The added length validation further enhances security by preventing resource exhaustion attacks.

### Performance Considerations
The profile operations meet the <100ms requirement specified in Dev Notes. The regex pattern compilation optimization will provide minor performance improvements for profile name validation, especially beneficial when listing multiple profiles.

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with proper architecture adherence, comprehensive testing, and thoughtful error handling. The refactoring improvements enhance both performance and security without changing the core functionality.
