# Story 1.4: Refactor ContextManager for Extensibility

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** the ContextManager refactored,  
**so that** its state-loading and saving logic can be easily extended to support profiles without modifying its core responsibilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The logic for reading from and writing to `state.json` is decoupled from the in-memory context management.
2. The refactored ContextManager maintains all existing functionality.
3. Unit tests are written for the ContextManager's core state manipulation methods (e.g., `add_files`, `remove_files`).
4. The class and its methods are documented to reflect the new internal structure.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create storage abstraction layer (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create storage/base.py with StorageBackend abstract class

## Dev Notes

### Current ContextManager Structure

```python
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.watched_patterns = set()
        self.ignore_patterns = set()
        self.files = set()
        self._load_state()

    def _load_state(self):
        # Loads from .contextr/state.json

    def save_state(self):
        # Saves to .contextr/state.json
```

### Proposed Storage Abstraction

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Dict, Optional

class StorageBackend(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save(self, key: str, data: Dict) -> None:
        """Save data with given key"""

    @abstractmethod
    def load(self, key: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
        """Load data by key"""

class JsonStorage(StorageBackend):
    def __init__(self, base_path: Path):
        self.base_path = base_path
```

### Refactored ContextManager Structure

```python
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self, storage: Optional[StorageBackend] = None):
        self.storage = storage or JsonStorage(Path(".contextr"))
        self.watched_patterns = set()
        self.ignore_patterns = set()
        self.files = set()
        self._load_state()
```

### Key Considerations

- Storage backend should be injectable for testing
- Default to current JSON storage for backward compatibility
- Keep the same state.json structure
- Storage abstraction prepares for future profile support
- All existing functionality must continue working

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests with mocked storage backend
- Integration tests with real file system
- Test backward compatibility explicitly
- Verify no performance regression

### Migration Path

1. Create storage abstraction
2. Refactor ContextManager incrementally
3. Ensure all tests pass at each step
4. No changes to CLI interface
5. State file format unchanged

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation successfully achieves the story's objectives with a clean, extensible design. The storage abstraction layer is well-designed using the Strategy pattern, providing excellent separation of concerns. The code maintains backward compatibility while preparing the codebase for future profile support. The implementation follows SOLID principles and demonstrates good software engineering practices.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/contextr/storage/json_storage.py
  - **Change**: Added atomic file write operations using temporary files
  - **Why**: Prevents data corruption if save operation is interrupted
  - **How**: Write to temp file first, then atomically rename to target file

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓] Follows project guidelines in CLAUDE.md
- Project Structure: [✓] Clean separation of storage layer from business logic
- Testing Strategy: [✓] Comprehensive unit tests with mocked storage
- All ACs Met: [✓] All 4 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Implemented atomic file writes for data integrity (storage/json_storage.py)
[ ] Consider adding file locking for concurrent access scenarios
[ ] Add logging for storage operations for better debugging
[ ] Consider implementing a caching layer for frequently accessed states
[ ] Add validation for state data structure on load

### Security Review

No significant security concerns found. The implementation properly handles file permissions and validates input paths. Consider adding path traversal protection for defense in depth, though the current implementation appears safe.

### Performance Considerations

The current implementation is efficient for typical use cases. File I/O is minimized through appropriate caching in the ContextManager. For very large contexts (>10k files), consider implementing lazy loading of state data.

### Final Status

[✓ Approved - Ready for Done]
