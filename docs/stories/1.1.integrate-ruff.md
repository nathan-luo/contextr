# Story 1.1: Integrate Ruff for Linting and Formatting

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,  
**I want** Ruff integrated into the project,  
**so that** code formatting and linting are automated and consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Ruff is added as a development dependency in `pyproject.toml`.
2. A `[tool.ruff]` configuration is added to `pyproject.toml` with rules for formatting, import sorting (`I`), and core pyflakes checks (`F`).
3. The entire existing codebase is successfully formatted and linted using the new Ruff configuration.
4. The project's contribution guidelines (`CLAUDE.md`) are updated with instructions on how to use Ruff.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add Ruff to development dependencies (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add ruff to pyproject.toml dev dependencies section
  - [ ] Run pip install -e . to install the new dependency
- [ ] Configure Ruff in pyproject.toml (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add [tool.ruff] section with line length matching Black (88)
  - [ ] Configure import sorting to match isort profile
  - [ ] Enable core linting rules (F, I, E, W)
  - [ ] Add appropriate ignore rules if needed
- [ ] Format and lint existing codebase (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Run ruff format on all Python files
  - [ ] Run ruff check and fix any linting issues
  - [ ] Verify all files pass both formatting and linting
- [ ] Update documentation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add Ruff commands to CLAUDE.md build section
  - [ ] Document the linting/formatting workflow

## Dev Notes

### Current Project Structure
- Python package using src/ layout
- Main modules: cli.py, manager.py, formatters.py, utils/
- Currently uses Black (line-length=88) and isort (profile="black")
- Build system: setuptools with pyproject.toml

### Ruff Configuration Guidelines
- Match existing Black line length (88 characters)
- Use isort-compatible import sorting
- Enable standard linting rules but be pragmatic about existing code
- Preserve existing code style where reasonable

### Testing Standards
- No formal testing framework currently in place (will be added in Story 1.3)
- For this story, manual verification of formatting/linting is sufficient
- Ensure no functionality is broken by formatting changes
