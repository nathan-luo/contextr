# Story 1.1: Integrate Ruff for Linting and Formatting

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** Ruff integrated into the project,  
**so that** code formatting and linting are automated and consistent.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Ruff is added as a development dependency in `pyproject.toml`.
2. A `[tool.ruff]` configuration is added to `pyproject.toml` with rules for formatting, import sorting (`I`), and core pyflakes checks (`F`).
3. The entire existing codebase is successfully formatted and linted using the new Ruff configuration.
4. The project's contribution guidelines (`CLAUDE.md`) are updated with instructions on how to use Ruff.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add Ruff to development dependencies (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add ruff to pyproject.toml dev dependencies section
  - [x] Run pip install -e . to install the new dependency
- [x] Configure Ruff in pyproject.toml (AC: 2)
  - [x] Add [tool.ruff] section with line length matching Black (88)
  - [x] Configure import sorting to match isort profile
  - [x] Enable core linting rules (F, I, E, W)
  - [x] Add appropriate ignore rules if needed
- [x] Format and lint existing codebase (AC: 3)
  - [x] Run ruff format on all Python files
  - [x] Run ruff check and fix any linting issues
  - [x] Verify all files pass both formatting and linting
- [x] Update documentation (AC: 4)
  - [x] Add Ruff commands to CLAUDE.md build section
  - [x] Document the linting/formatting workflow

## Dev Notes

### Current Project Structure

- Python package using src/ layout
- Main modules: cli.py, manager.py, formatters.py, utils/
- Currently uses Black (line-length=88) and isort (profile="black")
- Build system: setuptools with pyproject.toml

### Ruff Configuration Guidelines

- Match existing Black line length (88 characters)
- Use isort-compatible import sorting
- Enable standard linting rules but be pragmatic about existing code
- Preserve existing code style where reasonable

### Testing Standards

- No formal testing framework currently in place (will be added in Story 1.3)
- For this story, manual verification of formatting/linting is sufficient
- Ensure no functionality is broken by formatting changes

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-23
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The Ruff integration has been implemented correctly. The configuration is well-structured and follows Python community best practices. The developer made the right choice to use the `uv` package manager and properly configured Ruff with appropriate rule sets.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: Multiple Python files (cli.py, conftest.py, test_path_utils.py)
  - **Change**: Applied Ruff formatting to ensure consistent code style
  - **Why**: Files were not fully formatted according to the configured Ruff rules
  - **How**: Running `uv run ruff format .` fixed minor formatting inconsistencies like trailing commas

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ All rules properly configured and enforced
- Project Structure: ✓ Changes align with existing structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ No tests required for this tooling story
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Fixed formatting inconsistencies in 3 files using Ruff
- [x] Verified all linting rules pass successfully
- [x] Confirmed configuration matches existing Black/isort settings

### Security Review
No security concerns - Ruff is a trusted development tool with no runtime impact.

### Performance Considerations
Ruff provides excellent performance for linting/formatting, significantly faster than traditional tools like Black+Flake8.

### Final Status
✓ Approved - Ready for Done
