# Story etc.2: Fix Windows Path Handling Issues

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** contextr maintainer,
**I want** the path handling utilities to work correctly on Windows,
**so that** Windows users can use contextr without encountering path-related test failures or runtime errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All path-related unit tests pass on Windows platform
2. Path separators are handled correctly across Windows, macOS, and Linux
3. Absolute paths on Windows with drive letters (e.g., D:\path) are handled properly
4. Path comparison logic accounts for Windows path case-insensitivity
5. Relative path conversion works correctly with Windows path separators
6. No hardcoded forward slashes in test assertions that expect OS-specific separators
7. Tests remain cross-platform compatible

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Path Utilities Module** [Source: architecture.md#utility-layer]

- Located at: src/contextr/utils/path_utils.py
- Provides cross-platform path handling functions
- Key functions: make_relative(), make_absolute(), normalize_paths()
- Must handle case-insensitive filesystems on Windows/macOS

**Testing Architecture** [Source: architecture.md#testing-architecture]

- Test files location: tests/unit/utils/test_path_utils.py
- Test framework: pytest with fixtures and mocking
- Coverage target: 80%+ (currently 62%)
- Must maintain cross-platform compatibility

**Code Quality Standards** [Source: architecture.md#code-quality-standards]

- Type Coverage: 100% with strict mode
- Test Coverage: Target 80%+
- Linting: Zero errors/warnings with Ruff
- All tests must pass on all supported platforms

### Previous Story Insights

From etc.1 (CI/CD Pipeline):

- CI workflow tests on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows
- All platforms must have passing tests for PR approval
- Test failures on any platform block releases

### Technical Details

**Windows Path Characteristics**:

- Uses backslashes (\) as path separators
- Has drive letters (C:\, D:\, etc.)
- Case-insensitive filesystem
- Different home directory structure (~\Documents vs ~/documents)

**Current Implementation Issues**:

1. make_relative() returns forward slashes even on Windows
2. Tests have hardcoded forward slashes in assertions
3. Windows absolute paths with drive letters not handled in test assertions
4. Path comparison doesn't account for Windows case-insensitivity properly

**Python Path Handling Best Practices**:

- Use pathlib.Path for path operations when possible
- Use os.sep for OS-specific separators
- Use Path.as_posix() only when POSIX paths are explicitly needed
- For path comparison, use Path objects or normalize separators

### File Locations Based on Project Structure

- Path utilities: src/contextr/utils/path_utils.py
- Path utility tests: tests/unit/utils/test_path_utils.py
- Manager storage tests: tests/unit/test_manager_storage.py
- JSON storage tests: tests/unit/test_storage/test_json_storage.py

### Testing Requirements

**Test Execution**:

- Run with: `uv run pytest`
- Specific test file: `uv run pytest tests/unit/utils/test_path_utils.py`
- With coverage: `uv run pytest --cov=contextr --cov-report=term-missing`

**Test Standards** [Source: pyproject.toml]:

- Test discovery: test\__.py and _\_test.py files
- Test paths: tests/ directory
- Must maintain existing test coverage level

### Technical Constraints

- Must maintain Python 3.12+ compatibility
- Cannot break existing functionality on Unix-like systems
- Must preserve the existing API of path utility functions
- Storage format must remain compatible across platforms

- [x] All tests updated for cross-platform compatibility
- [x] Proper handling of symlinks with graceful skip on unsupported systems
- [x] Storage tests updated to use Path objects for path construction
- [x] Creative solution for permission test using monkeypatch instead of chmod

### Security Review
No security concerns identified. The implementation:
- Uses Path.resolve() to handle symlinks securely
- Properly validates paths before operations
- No path traversal vulnerabilities

### Performance Considerations
The implementation is efficient:
- Uses string operations for case-insensitive comparison only when needed (Windows/Darwin)
- Avoids unnecessary path resolutions
- Efficient use of Path objects with proper caching
- No performance regression introduced

### Technical Highlights
1. **Smart Platform Detection**: The code correctly identifies Windows and Darwin for case-insensitive handling
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Proper handling of empty relative paths returning "."
