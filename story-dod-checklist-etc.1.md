## Final Confirmation

### Summary of Accomplishments:
- Created complete CI/CD pipeline infrastructure for the contextr project
- Implemented multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS) with Python 3.12 and 3.13
- Set up automated PyPI deployment with secure trusted publishing support
- Documented comprehensive release process and development workflow
- Created PR template to ensure code quality

### Items Not Done:
- AC 5: Branch protection rules - Requires manual GitHub configuration
- AC 7: PyPI secrets configuration - Requires manual PyPI account setup

### Technical Debt/Follow-up:
- Manual configuration required for:
  1. GitHub branch protection rules
  2. PyPI account and trusted publishing setup
  3. Repository secrets (PYPI_API_TOKEN, CODECOV_TOKEN)
  4. Setting dev as default branch

### Challenges/Learnings:
- GitHub Actions workflows cannot be fully tested until pushed to repository
- Trusted publishing is the recommended approach for PyPI deployment security
- uv package manager integration works well with GitHub Actions

### Ready for Review:
✅ Yes - All development tasks are complete. Manual configuration steps are documented and expected to be done by the maintainer with appropriate access.

- [x] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed.
